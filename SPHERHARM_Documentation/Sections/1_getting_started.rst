====================
This document describes the implementation of the DEM using Spherical Harmonic within the Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS).

LAMMPS is a particle simulation code, developed and maintained at Sandia National Laboratories, USA. While is primarily aimed at Molecular Dynamics simulations of atomistic systems, it provides a general, fully parallelized framework for particle simulations governed by Newtonâ€™s equations of motion.
