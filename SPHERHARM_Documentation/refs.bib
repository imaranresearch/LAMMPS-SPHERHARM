The system has several degrees of freedom that can be fixed, for instance, by enforcing the cells aspect ratios. Therefore, the cells can have very comparable forms, i.e. close to the square. This kind of method is effectively useful because it is not possible to build exact dense uniform distributions of points on the sphere. However, it will be shown that it is easy to cover the sphere, the hemisphere or the disk with equal-area cells. This capability makes easy, for instance, the implementation of stratified sampling in Monte Carlo methods. Moreover, the use of different azimuthal projections allows to link problems initially stated either on the hemisphere or within the circle.},

abstract = {A theory of pebble erosion is presented, based on the assumption that the rate of erosion at a point on the surface is a function Vof the curvature there. It is proved that for physically reasonable functions V,the sphere is the only shape of pebble which can maintain its proportions as it wears away. An argument is given which leads to a particular form for the function Vand a few qualitative consequences of this form are indicated. The surface of the pebble at time tmay be described using spherical polar coordinates $\theta$, $\Phi$ by the radius function r ($\theta$, $\Phi$, t). This function is given by a highly nonlinear partial differential equation. However, in the case of the erosion of a deformed sphere, when terms which are of second order or higher in the deformation are neglected, the equation becomes linear and is a version of the diffusion equation. The stability of the spherical shape against deformations of the various harmonic types is then easily analyzed.},

abstract = {Truncated spherical harmonic expansions are used to approximate the shape of 3D star-shaped particles including a wide range of axially symmetric ellipsoids, cuboids, and over 40.000 real particles drawn from seven different material sources. This mathematical procedure enables any geometric property to be calculated for these star-shaped particles. Calculations are made of properties such as volume, surface area, triaxial dimensions, the maximum inscribed sphere, and the minimum enclosing sphere, as well as differential geometric properties such as surface normals and principal curvatures, and the values are compared to the analytical values for well-characterized geometric shapes. We find that a particle's Krumbein triaxial dimensions, widely used in the sedimentary geology literature, are essentially identical numerically to the length, width, and thickness dimensions that are used to characterize gravel shape in the construction aggregate industry. Of these dimensions, we prove that the length is a lower bound on a particle's minimum enclosing sphere diameter and that the thickness is an upper bound on its maximum inscribed sphere diameter. We examine the “true sphericity” and the shape entropy, and we also introduce a new sphericity factor based on the radius ratio of the maximum inscribed sphere to the minimum enclosing sphere. This bounding sphere ratio, which can be calculated numerically or approximated from macroscopic dimensions, has the advantage that it is less sensitive to surface roughness than the true sphericity. For roundness, we extend Wadell's classical 2D definition for particle silhouettes to 3D shapes and we also introduce a new roundness factor based on integrating the dot product of the surface position unit vector and the unit normal vector. Limited evidence suggests that the latter roundness factor more faithfully captures the common notion of roundness based on visual perception of particle shapes, and it is significantly simpler to calculate than the classical roundness factor.},

abstract = {A novel approach is presented for simulating non-spherical particles in the discrete element method (DEM). A particle's shape is described through a hierarchy of representations using spherical harmonic expansions. The expansion is computed at nodes, obtained by discretising the particle's surface. A low-degree expansion, i.e., one containing few terms, is sufficient to approximate a particle's overall shape without any surface texture. Expansions are computed to high degrees only at interparticle contacts, rather than for the entire particle, which reduces the computational cost. The advantages of this approach include the ability to simulate a wide range of particle shapes and adaptive resolution depending on spatial and temporal considerations. An additional unique benefit is that changes of particle shape due to chipping can be captured in DEM for the first time. This is accomplished by progressively omitting more of the highest-degree terms from the expansion to give an increasingly smooth surface.},

abstract = {Ballast grains in railway tracks progressively wear due to the efforts exerted by the continuous passage of trains and the periodic maintenance operations. The initial sharp edges and vertices of the grains tend to become smoother and the surface texture is removed. This change in morphology plays a key role on the proper behaviour of the ballast layer and, consequently, on the frequency maintenance required on the track. The object of this paper is to improve the understanding of the wear process by tracking the morphology of a sample of grains submitted to an accelerated ageing using the Micro-Deval standard test. To this goal, X-ray Computed Tomography is used to scan a sample of grains at different states of wear and the resulting images are compared using 3D image analysis. A description of morphology evolution at different scales is provided using scalar parameters and spherical harmonic analysis, proving that the general form is not significantly changed during a standard Micro-Deval test. Thus a detailed analysis at the asperity level is performed, showing the key role of the edge broadening and vertex smoothing phenomena on ballast wear.},

abstract = {River-bed sediments display two universal downstream trends: fining, in which particle size decreases; and rounding, where pebble shapes evolve toward ellipsoids. Rounding is known to result from transport-induced abrasion; however many researchers argue that the contribution of abrasion to downstream fining is negligible. This presents a paradox: downstream shape change indicates substantial abrasion, while size change apparently rules it out. Here we use laboratory experiments and numerical modeling to show quantitatively that pebble abrasion is a curvature-driven flow problem. As a consequence, abrasion occurs in two well-separated phases: first, pebble edges rapidly round without any change in axis dimensions until the shape becomes entirely convex; and second, axis dimensions are then slowly reduced while the particle remains convex. Explicit study of pebble shape evolution helps resolve the shape-size paradox by reconciling discrepancies between laboratory and field studies, and enhances our ability to decipher the transport history of a river rock. {\textcopyright} 2014 Domokos et al.},

When the potential is a function of the contact volume, a special contact model with clear geometric meanings is developed as described by the theorem of Contact Volume Based Model.

It is derived based solely on the requirement that the potential energy must be conserved for an elastic impact of two shapes under any condition. The resulting general energy-conserving contact model states that the normal force as a vector must be the gradient of a contact potential field. When such a contact potential or energy function is specified, a complete normal contact model for a pair of arbitrarily shaped particles, including the contact normal direction, contact point/line and force magnitude, will be automatically followed without introducing any additional assumptions. In this framework, the contact geometry and contact force are indispensably related and are evaluated in a consistent manner. Due to the paramount role that the energy function plays in the current theory, its fundamental properties are discussed, which serve as general guidance for choosing a valid energy function. In addition, both single and multiple contacts and their evolution can be handled in a seamless way. Some symmetric properties of particle shapes can also be utilised to simplify the contact models. Within the proposed theoretical framework, different choices or combinations of geometric features as variables for the contact energy function can give rise to unique types of energy-conserving contact models with distinct characteristics and features. Two such functions using only one primary feature, which lead to two specialised energy-conserving contact models, will be presented in the subsequent papers of this series.},

abstract = {The contact volume based energy-conserving contact model is presented in the current paper as a specialised version of the general energy-conserving contact model established in the first paper of this series (Feng, 2020). It is based on the assumption that the contact energy potential is taken to be a function of the contact volume between two contacting bodies with arbitrary (convex and concave) shapes in both 2D and 3D cases. By choosing such a contact energy function, the full normal contact features can be determined without the need to introduce any additional assumptions/parameters. By further exploiting the geometric properties of the contact surfaces concerned, more effective integration schemes are developed to reduce the evaluation costs involved. When a linear contact energy function of the contact volume is adopted, a linear contact model is derived in which only the intersection between two contact shapes is needed, thereby substantially improving both efficiency and applicability of the proposed contact model. A comparison of this linear energy-conserving contact model with some existing models for discs and spheres further reveals the nature of the proposed model, and provides insights into how to appropriately choose the stiffness parameter included in the energy function. For general non-spherical shapes, mesh representations are required. The corresponding computational aspects are described when shapes are discretised into volumetric meshes, while new developments are presented and recommended for shapes that are represented by surface triangular meshes. Owing to its additive property of the contact geometric features involved, the proposed contact model can be conducted locally in parallel using GPU or GPGPU computing without occurring much communication overhead for shapes represented as either a volumetric or surface triangular mesh. A set of examples considering the elastic impact of two shapes are presented to verify the energy-conserving property of the proposed model for a wide range of concave shapes and contact scenarios, followed by examples involving large numbers of arbitrarily shaped particles to demonstrate the robustness and applicability for more complex and realistic problems.},

This review article describes how this is done, in some detail, and then gives examples of applications of this method, including a contact function that is suitable for these random shape particles.

abstract = {Using a spherical harmonic series, the three-dimensional shape of star-shaped particles (e.g. most powders, sand, gravel) can be represented mathematically as readily as can a sphere, cube, or ellipsoid. In principle, any particle parameter, such as volume, surface area, moment of inertia tensor, or integrated mean curvature, can be easily computed. In this paper, we extend this list by developing three important algorithms, which have been found useful for regular particles, and adapt them to the case of random star-shaped particles using spherical harmonic series. These three algorithms are: a two-particle contact function, how to add a uniform-thickness shell to a single particle, and estimation of the convexity of a single particle using an algorithm for computing the convex hulls of non-convex particles. A derivation and numerical examples are shown for each algorithm. The two-particle contact function may be used in random particle placement programs, so that random-shaped particles may be used in suspension models as readily as spheres or ellipsoids. New results are shown for how the volume of a uniform-thickness shell, normalized by the surface area of the original particle, depends on the shell thickness t. For a sphere, the exact expression is cubic in t, with the linear coefficient unity and the quadratic coefficient equal to the reciprocal of the sphere radius. For star-shaped particles, the coefficient of the linear term is also unity. For all star-shaped particles considered, the coefficient of the quadratic term in t is approximately equal to the reciprocal of the radius of the volume-equivalent sphere, to within a few percent. The convexity measure, using convex hulls, adds to the list of useful shape parameters for random star-shaped particles and is shown to distinguish between different particle sets.},

The original 3-D particle images are acquired via X-ray tomography.

abstract = {Granular material (GM) is the second most manipulated substance in the world and is present in most industries either as raw materials or finished products. Often the temperature of the granular material needs to be manipulated for example in the case of heating iron ore to induce a phase change or to be kept within a certain temperature range in the case of pharmaceutical powders and food products. Thus a detailed understanding of how heat is transferred in granular materials is essential. The most feasible numerical approach to study heat transfer in granular materials is using the discrete element method (DEM), where each particle is explicitly modeled. In terms of conductive heat transfer particle shape can be expected to have a significant effect on the heating of granular materials, due to the nature of the grain to grain contacts and packing topology which control the heat flow paths and the rate that heat is conducted along these. This paper considers the effect of particle shape on heat conduction in thermally simple or low Biot number granular materials using a polyhedral particle representation. The volume based contact model for granular heat conduction is firstly verified against the analytical solution for solid heat conduction as well as experiment with cubic particles. The resulting model is then used to study the effect of particle shape on the effective thermal conductivity (ETC) and heat distribution within packed stationary beds. It was found that for irregularly shaped (polyhedral) particles the ETC does not have a linear relationship with the packing density as found in previous studies with spherical and ellipsoidal shaped particles. Rather that there is an exponential dependence on the micro-structural quantities of contact area and isotropy, with non-homogeneity in the packing density resulting in complex conduction paths and dead zones affecting conduction thru the bed.},

A fundamental understanding of the influence and interaction of coke and ore particles on the burden topography and packing density is therefore essential, in particular, the influence of particle shape polydispersity and particle size polydispersity. In this paper we analyze the effect of particle shape and size polydispersity on the coke and ore charge distribution inside a bell-less blast furnace using the discrete element method (DEM). We first validate experimentally the polyhedral particle model with a simplified lab-scale charging experiment. A comparative study between spheres, with rolling friction to account for shape, and polyhedra is conducted for shape and size polydisperse particle systems. It was found that shape polydispersity mainly influenced the topography of the burden, whereas the size polydispersity mainly influenced the inter-layer percolation, i.e. localized particle diffusion, hence the local spatial packing density. The differences between the spherical particle models and polyhedral particle models on the burden topography are also quantitatively and qualitatively presented, especially on the role of particle shape on the push-up of coke in the centre. This study demonstrates that modelling particle shape effects using spheres with rolling friction is insufficient to fully describe the complex behaviour of shaped particles in a blast furnace, as the particle shape has a noteworthy influence on the burden characteristics.},

For illustration, the models are calibrated to the geometrical features of a population of 128 similar ASTM C57 aggregates used in concrete. The first model is a sum of spherical harmonic functions with random non-Gaussian coefficients. The second model is a nonlinear memoryless mapping of a sum of spherical harmonic functions with Gaussian coefficients.

We first discuss basic facts about numerical integration rules with positive weights. Then some important types of rules are discussed in detail: rules with a specified polynomial degree of precision, including the important case of longitude--latitude rules; rules using scattered data points; rules based on equal-area partitions; and rules for numerical integration over subsets of the sphere. Finally we show that for numerical integration over the whole sphere and for functions with an appropriate degree of smoothness, an optimal rate of convergence can be achieved by positive-weight rules with polynomial precision, and also by rules obtained by integrating a suitable radial basis function interpolant.},

abstract = {This paper presents rules for numerical integration over spherical caps and discusses their properties. For a spherical cap on the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$, we discuss tensor product rules with n2/2 + O(n) nodes in the cap, positive weights, which are exact for all spherical polynomials of degree ≤ n, and can be easily and inexpensively implemented. Numerical tests illustrate the performance of these rules. A similar derivation establishes the existence of equal weight rules with degree of polynomial exactness n and O(n3) nodes for numerical integration over spherical caps on $\mathbb{S}^2$. For arbitrary d ≥ 2, this strategy is extended to provide rules for numerical integration over spherical caps on $\mathbb{S}^d$that have O(nd) nodes in the cap, positive weights, and are exact for all spherical polynomials of degree ≤ n. We also show that positive weight rules for numerical integration over spherical caps on $\mathbb{S}^d$that are exact for all spherical polynomials of degree ≤ n have at least O(nd) nodes and possess a certain regularity property.},

abstract = {This paper presents discrete element method (DEM) simulations with experimental comparisons at multiple length scales—underscoring the crucial role of particle shape. The simulations build on technological advances in the DEM furnished by level sets (LS-DEM), which enable the mathematical representation of the surface of arbitrarily-shaped particles such as grains of sand. We show that this ability to model shape enables unprecedented capture of the mechanics of granular materials across scales ranging from macroscopic behavior to local behavior to particle behavior. Specifically, the model is able to predict the onset and evolution of shear banding in sands, replicating the most advanced high-fidelity experiments in triaxial compression equipped with sequential X-ray tomography imaging. We present comparisons of the model and experiment at an unprecedented level of quantitative agreement—building a one-to-one model where every particle in the more than 53,000-particle array has its own avatar or numerical twin. Furthermore, the boundary conditions of the experiment are faithfully captured by modeling the membrane effect as well as the platen displacement and tilting. The results show a computational tool that can give insight into the physics and mechanics of granular materials undergoing shear deformation and failure, with computational times comparable to those of the experiment. One quantitative measure that is extracted from the LS-DEM simulations that is currently not available experimentally is the evolution of three dimensional force chains inside and outside of the shear band. We show that the rotations on the force chains are correlated to the rotations in stress principal directions.},

abstract = {Discrete element method (DEM) has been widely used to study granular materials. However, how to model non-spherical particles is still challenging. Ellipsoidal particles are a typical kind of non-spherical particles in DEM simulations. There are three common methods to calculate the overlap and contact force between two ellipsoidal particles, namely, geometric potential (GP), common normal (CN) and overlap region (OR) methods. These methods are based on different physical concepts and hence will give different results. However, the comprehensive evaluation of these methods is still lacking, leaving DEM users no solid reference for selecting algorithms. In this paper, we conduct detailed comparisons on the penetration depth, contact plane and contact point predicted by the three methods. Particularly, using the orientation discretization method, the results are compared in all orientations quantitatively. It is shown that the difference between GP and CN is the largest whereas OR is always in between. The difference in contact point is relatively small when overlap ratio is small, whereas the difference in contact plane can always be large. Further, the results are directly compared to those obtained from sub-particle scale finite element analyses, which reveals that CN can always accurately predict contact plane and most times contact point, while GP are relatively better in predicting force magnitude. This study not only gives a more clear and comprehensive evaluation of different contact force models for ellipsoidal particles but also establishes an effective framework for comparing and verifying contact force models for general non-spherical particles.},

abstract = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently—those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers--the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90% and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C9O processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional imaging techniques, such as X-ray computed tomography, have been used to scan realistic particle geometries. However, these techniques are labor intensive, time-consuming, and costly to obtain a large number of particles. Therefore, it is desirable if computers can be taught to generate realistic particles based on given morphological properties. This paper develops a particle generation technique by integrating spherical harmonics and probability functions. This technique only requires morphological information from one particle to generate a large number of particles and eliminates the need for scanning many particles for particle generation. The spherical harmonics coefficients of this particle are analog of the morphological gene. The probability function is used to add variances to spherical harmonics coefficients to simulate gene mutation. A dimensionless factor is developed to control degrees of gene mutation. The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed technique are verified by particle shape descriptors computed by the computational geometry techniques.},

abstract = {Particles encountered in nature and engineering practice are normally not spherical but of irregular shapes. Particle shape plays a key role in determining the behaviour of bulk solids, which poses a number of challenges in modelling and simulation of particulate systems. Discrete element method (DEM) has been recognized as a promising method to meet the challenges. This paper presents a review of the recent efforts in developing DEM approaches to model non-spherical particulate systems (NSPS) and strategies of coupling such a non-spherical DEM model with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for particle-fluid flows. It mainly covers four important aspects: the techniques for representation of non-spherical particles and their contact detection, the models describing inter-particle collision dynamics and fluid-particle forces, CFD-DEM coupling methodologies including averaged volume method and immersed family methods and the applications of the developed theories to the modelling of different NSPS. The main findings are discussed and summarized as a part of the review. Finally, the needs for future development are highlighted.},

abstract = {The particle micromorphology created by geological processes is an essential characteristic in determining the mechanical properties of natural sands. Based on micro X-ray computed tomography ($\mu$CT) data, we introduce a mathematical procedure using spherical harmonics to characterize and reconstruct the particle micromorphology in three dimensions. The basic geometric properties of natural sand particles, volume and surface area, and two empirical engineering indices, sphericity and angularity, are the main focus of the investigation using spherical harmonic analysis. By validating the spherical harmonic analysis against the tomography data, it is shown to be a robust technique for reproducing particle micromorphology in terms of the shape irregularity and surface texture. The precision of the method depends on the resolution of the $\mu$CT and the maximum harmonic degree used. Finally, by using principal component analysis for spherical harmonic descriptors of the scanned particles, two different kinds of sand assemblies consisting of statistically reconstructed particles with random shapes but major morphological features are successfully generated. This approach will be useful for the efficient discrete element modeling of real sands in the future.},

abstract = {Discrete element method (DEM) of granular sands incorporating the effect of the realistic particle shape has been an important issue for many years. In this context, this study proposed a novel framework for the generation of realistic-shaped particles of natural sands in 3D DEM simulations. The generation framework mainly included micro-CT ($\mu$CT) scanning of sand particles, image processing of $\mu$CT images, spherical harmonic reconstruction of the particle surface, and clump generation by the overlapping multisphere clump method (OMCM) in DEM simulations. To validate the accuracy of OMCM, the volume and inertia moment of the clump were carefully investigated, and a set of optimized generation parameters was then determined to ensure the accuracy of the clump and the limit number of the filling spheres. Based on the generation framework, a clump sample with realistic particle shapes and a corresponding sphere sample were generated to conduct a series of direct shear testing. The simulation results demonstrated that the realistic particle shape highly increases the particle interlocking rather than the anisotropic intensity of strong contact force chains, and in turn enhances the shear resistance and the shear-induced dilation of the sands. It was also found that the inter-particle contacts of the clump sample have higher friction mobilization than that of the sphere sample, which identified the micromechanism of the shape effect on the particle interlocking.},
